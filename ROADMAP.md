# Orbit Auth — Roadmap (alpha)

This is a lightweight public roadmap for the early alpha phase.

## Near-term

- Improve admin UX and onboarding flow
- Clarify configuration and deployment docs (non-Vercel hosting included)
- Add more social providers behind global feature flags
- Add basic audit events for admin actions

## Longer-term

- Provider credential management (pluggable secret providers; no hard Vercel lock-in)
- Branding (logo upload) once a storage provider is supported
- Stronger multi-tenant / organization model (if needed)
- Observability (metrics, structured logs, tracing)
