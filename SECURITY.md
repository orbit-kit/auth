# Security Policy

Orbit Auth is an early alpha project and is **not** recommended for production use.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security reports.

Instead, email the maintainer(s) with:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Minimal reproduction steps or a PoC
- Affected version/commit (if known)

## Scope

- Auth server (`apps/auth`)
- SDK (`packages/auth-sdk`)
- Example apps are out of scope unless they expose a security issue in the server/SDK
