description: What Orbit Auth alpha means, and what to expect.
---

Orbit Auth is currently an **early alpha** proof of concept.

**Do not use this project in production** (even if it appears to work).

## What “alpha” means

- Breaking changes can happen without notice (APIs, database schema, UI)
- Security hardening is incomplete
- Upgrade and migration paths are not guaranteed
- Behavior and defaults may change frequently

## Safe ways to evaluate

- Use test data only
- Run on local / staging environments
- Keep secrets in your host’s secret manager (env vars)

## Branding

Orbit Auth supports minimal branding:

- Custom auth name (dashboard setting)
- Show/hide built-in logo (dashboard setting)

Logo upload is intentionally not available until a storage provider is supported.
