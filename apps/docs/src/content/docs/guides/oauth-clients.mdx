title: OAuth Clients
description: Create and manage OAuth clients from the admin dashboard.
---

## Only one way to create clients

OAuth clients are created from the Orbit Auth admin dashboard.

- Go to `http://localhost:5000/admin`
- Open OAuth Clients
- Create Client

Client creation scripts are intentionally removed to keep one consistent, auditable path.

## Global password policy

“Compromised Password Protection” is configured globally from the admin settings page.

## Trusted origins (CORS)

To let a frontend call the auth server, add its origin to `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`:

```txt
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:4000,https://app.example.com
```

Restart the auth server after changing environment variables.

## Redirect URIs

Redirect URIs must match exactly (scheme/host/path). Common examples:

- React SPA: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Next.js app callback route: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/oauth2/callback/your-provider`

## Scopes

Typical scopes:

- `openid`
- `profile`
- `email`
- `offline_access` (refresh tokens)
