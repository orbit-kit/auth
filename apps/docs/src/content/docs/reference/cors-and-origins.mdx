title: CORS and Trusted Origins
description: Fix cross-origin requests and session cookies.
---

## The rule

If a browser app calls the auth server from a different origin, that origin must be trusted.

Set `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` on the auth server to a comma-separated list of allowed origins:

```txt
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173,https://app.example.com
```

Restart the auth server after changing environment variables.

## Common symptoms

- Browser console shows CORS errors
- Session cookies are missing
- `userinfo` requests fail when called from a client app

## Notes

- During development, localhost origins are allowed.
- In production, make sure you include the exact scheme + host (and port if applicable).
