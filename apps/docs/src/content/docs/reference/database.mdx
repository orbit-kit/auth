## Required env var

The auth server requires `DATABASE_URL`:

```txt
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

## Migrations

From `apps/auth`:

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

## Seed the first admin

From `apps/auth`:

```bash
npm run seed
```

This creates an admin user if one does not already exist.
