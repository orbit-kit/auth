title: Compromised password protection (HIBP)
description: Block known-breached passwords using the Pwned Passwords “range” API.
---

## Why this is free

Have I Been Pwned has multiple APIs with different pricing.

Orbit Auth uses the Pwned Passwords “range” endpoint (k‑anonymity) which does not require an API key for basic checks:

```txt
https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first5Sha1Hex}
```

This is different from other HIBP APIs (e.g. searching breached accounts) that are API-key / subscription based.

## How it works (k‑anonymity)

- The server hashes the password with SHA‑1.
- Only the first 5 hex characters are sent to the API.
- The response is a list of suffixes for that prefix.
- The server checks the suffix locally.

## Orbit Auth behavior

Orbit Auth enforces this check during:

- Sign up
- Password change
- Password reset

You can toggle it globally from the admin settings page.
