title: NetworkError after sign-in
description: Fix redirect handling when signing in on the auth server.
---

## Symptom

After email/password sign-in, the server succeeds but the browser shows:

- `NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource`

## Why it happens

Some sign-in endpoints respond with redirects. If a client `fetch()` follows the redirect automatically, you can end up trying to parse a non-JSON response.

## What Orbit Auth does

The auth server’s internal client uses a custom fetch implementation that:

- Uses manual redirect for the sign-in/sign-up POST endpoints
- Treats redirect responses as success
