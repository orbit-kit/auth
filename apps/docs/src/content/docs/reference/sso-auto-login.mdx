## Endpoint

Orbit Auth exposes a cross-origin session check endpoint:

```txt
GET /api/auth/session-check
```

It returns minimal data:

- `authenticated`
- `user.id`, `user.email`, `user.name` (when authenticated)

## Typical client flow

1. Your app checks its own session (if any).
2. If not logged in locally, call the auth server’s session-check endpoint with credentials.
3. If `authenticated: true`, start the OAuth flow.

## CORS

Allow your client origin by adding it to `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` on the auth server and restarting.
